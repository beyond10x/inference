# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- The Cargo workspace under `crates/` and its first crate, `inference-core`: the `inference.model`
  vocabulary of `ess/domains/model.yaml` (models, adapters, capabilities, modalities, locality,
  execution form, the concurrency refusal) and the shared identifiers of runs, nodes, streams,
  generations and sessions, read only in the canonical Uuid spelling.
- `task check` runs `cargo fmt`, `cargo clippy -D warnings` and `cargo test` after the
  specification and planning checks.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-10-19

The design, its specification and its plan. No code yet.

### Added

- `docs/design/inference.md`, the design (v0.2): vocabulary, contracts, streaming semantics, the
  graph, the runtime, the roadmap and the open questions; `docs/design/review-2026-10-18.md`, its
  review, with the owner's decisions on each finding.
- `ess/`, the ESS specification: `system.yaml`, `ess-inputs.yaml` and six domain documents
  (model, policy, graph, stream, tools, session) with 17 entities and 36 commands, every
  declaration citing the design line it was read from; `ess verify conform synthesize` yields
  153 scenarios with 0 refusals.
- `.engineering/planning`, the AEP planning store: a vision, product requirements, an
  architecture design, the ESS record, 12 epics, 22 stories with typed scope in 18 waves, 4
  decision blockers and 24 review results from two critic rounds.
- `Taskfile.yml` with `task check`; `.github/workflows/check.yml` runs it with pinned `ess`
  0.60.0 and `aep` 0.74.0 releases; `.github/workflows/shared-gates.yml` calls the common source
  gates at an exact commit.
