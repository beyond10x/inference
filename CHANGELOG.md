# Changelog

## [0.2.0] — 2026-10-19

### Added

- The Cargo workspace under `crates/` and its first crate, `inference-core`: the `inference.model`
  vocabulary of `ess/domains/model.yaml` (models, adapters, capabilities, modalities, locality,
  execution form, the concurrency refusal) and the shared identifiers of runs, nodes, streams,
  generations and sessions, read only in the canonical Uuid spelling.
- `task check` runs `cargo fmt`, `cargo clippy -D warnings` and `cargo test` after the
  specification and planning checks.
- `ess/scenarios/`: four authored scenarios for what ess 0.60.0 synthesis does not reach: the
  discard cascades of supersede, cancel and run cancellation (ESS-SYNTH-001), and a Draining run
  that fails.

### Changed

- The specification fixes 66 findings of a hardening pass and five reviews (13 P1): a superseded
  or cancelled generation emits, commits, queues and plays nothing more; the tool barrier reads
  the tool's class and the span's state instead of the caller's claim; profiles are checked
  against the design's table; runs, sessions and graph edits refuse the wrong pipeline or run
  state; refusals carry typed diagnostics. Breaking against 0.1.0 (`ess verify diff`, exit 4):
  new enum members, `FailRun.failure: FailureReason` replacing `reason`, new required inputs on
  `DeclareModel`, `DeclareTool` and `ProposeToolCall`, the new `DeclareProfile` refusal.

### Known issues

- `ess verify conform synthesize` yields 229 scenarios with 3 ESS-SYNTH-001 refusals, the
  `affects` cascades of `CancelRun`, `CancelGeneration` and `SupersedeGeneration`; the authored
  scenarios execute them and the interpreted run passes 229 of 229.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-10-19

The design, its specification and its plan. No code yet.

### Added

- `docs/design/inference.md`, the design (v0.2): vocabulary, contracts, streaming semantics, the
  graph, the runtime, the roadmap and the open questions; `docs/design/review-2026-10-18.md`, its
  review, with the owner's decisions on each finding.
- `ess/`, the ESS specification: `system.yaml`, `ess-inputs.yaml` and six domain documents
  (model, policy, graph, stream, tools, session) with 17 entities and 36 commands, every
  declaration citing the design line it was read from; `ess verify conform synthesize` yields
  153 scenarios with 0 refusals.
- `.engineering/planning`, the AEP planning store: a vision, product requirements, an
  architecture design, the ESS record, 12 epics, 22 stories with typed scope in 18 waves, 4
  decision blockers and 24 review results from two critic rounds.
- `Taskfile.yml` with `task check`; `.github/workflows/check.yml` runs it with pinned `ess`
  0.60.0 and `aep` 0.74.0 releases; `.github/workflows/shared-gates.yml` calls the common source
  gates at an exact commit.
